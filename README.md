# Help Fix Translations

See a mistake or something missing? You can fix it yourself in 2 minutes.

## How to Fix a Translation:
1. Click on the file you want to fix (like `base-en` for English or other language files).
2. Click the **pencil icon** at the top right (says "Edit this file").
3. Github might ask you to fork the repository, just press on it. 
4. Make your changes.
5. Press on the **"Commit changes"** button.
6. Click **"Propose changes"**.
7  Click **"Create pull request"**.
Done.

## Important Rules:
- Only change the **base-en** file for English text.
- For other languages, edit the correct language file.
- If something is not being translated and always shows in English, mention it in your pull request or open an issue.

## Why This Way?
Issues can take a long time to be fixed manually.
Pull requests are checked faster and are the best way to get your fix into the game.
